# Purpose
Now there has a lot of media company, but they won the data, means they can delete your video at any time and tell you: you broke some rules.
So I am thinking about create a new platform base on block chain, IPFS. there is no admin, no one can delete your video.
# Some Feature
- People need save video first to earn some `COIN`. when they have earn enough `COIN`, they can upload and share their videos(The cost depends on the size of the data). 
- When people view your video, give Thumbs up, save, donate. the data saver, the data uploader can earn the `COIN`.
- No administer.
- The ownership is clear, you have the data ownership that you uploaded. 
- videos can't be deleted after they are uploaded, not even by the author.

# Shortcoming
- How to avoid pornography, violence.
